# Smart_Lens
A prototype which can show various functions of smart phone in real-time on a screen in front of the user connected to user's glasses.

(Project was build in 24-hour hackathon (HackUIET 2019) at UIET,Panjab University and won a THIRD PRIZE)

This project contains a hardware assembly of OLED (0.96" 128x32 i2c), Arduino Nano, Bluetooth (HC-05), and DHT11
 (Temperatur and Humidity sensor) within a 3-d printed box and a custom build app named Smart_Lens using MIT app inventer.
 
Funtions such as Date, Time, Location, Steps covered, and a notification when you will receive a phonecall or a text message on your 
device which is connected to Smart_Lens via bluetooth. An adiitional push button is also added which upon a press will show the
current Temperature and Humidity using DHT11 to the display.

Arduino and Application(.aia) files are added here.
